	 *  At this point if you have excced the 500kb mark of the file it will then 'roll' over to another file and create a new log file. 
	 *  -the old file will have the YYYY-DD-MM marker in its name. i.e 'prints-2019-12-03.log'
	 *  
	 *  In this lesson we will run the program and logging excercise with the code contained in Lesson_182 of Project Log4jTutorial
