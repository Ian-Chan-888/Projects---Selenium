	 *  1. What is Maven: 
	 *  Maven is a software project managment and build management tool for Java Frameworks. 
	 *  
	 *  Why Maven? 
	 *  - Central repository to get dependencies
	 *  	 	- Your 'Java Build path' is a component of your Java framework but the issue is that this is personalized to you as per the file locations locations. 
	 *  		- Maven will help with this with the help of a Maven repository.  https://mvnrepository.com
	 *  		- therefore this centralized the dependant files in one area. More on how in later lessons.
	 *  
	 *  - Maintaining common structure across the organization
	 *  - Flexibility in integration with CI tools
	 *  - Pulgins for Test framework execution.
