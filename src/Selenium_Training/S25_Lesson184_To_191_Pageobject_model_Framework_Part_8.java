	 * What is the Page Object Pattern? 
	 * - Page Object Model is a design pattern which has become popular in test automation for enhancing test maintenance and reducing code duplication. 
	 * 
	 *  I idea behind Page Ojbect is to define the objects (i.e web elements) of a particular page then classify them in a repository. 
	 *  The test cases then can use this library to write more meaninful tests. 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * -Easy to maintain
	 * -Easy Readability of scripts
	 * -Reduce or Elimate duplicacy
	 * -Re-usability of code
	 * -Realiability.

	 *  Lesson 185 Creating Page object Consgtructor in classes. For this example we will use the "Pageobject" project. Found in your git hub under Training Projects.
	 *  - The idea here is to create a library of objects specific to a web page. So that when we run tests we can call these objects. Thus makes things modular and clean.
	 *   in this example we will use rediff.com
	 *  
	 *  Lets create a new project and name it 'Pageobject'
	 *   -import all the slenium jars.
	 *   
	 *   -create a package "objectrepository"
	 *   		-create a Java class "RediffLoginpage" Note: these classes should not have the publick class main statements.
	 *   		
	 *   		 
	 *   -create a package "TestCases"
	 *    create tests cases that will

	 *    
	 *    Page Factory: 
	 *    Requires: import org.openqa.selenium.support.PageFactory;
	 *    
	 *    This runs on the same concept as the regular page object but it uses specific if not cleaner notations like 
	 *    - '@FindB'
	 *
